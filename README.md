# The THE Counter

The The Counter is a fun little app I made to find all the "the"s on any given webpage

## Tech Stack

- Python
- React
- BeautifulSoup4

## MVP

- Query a URL to locate all the "the"s on the page
- Different messages based on quantity of "the"s

## Stretch Goals

- User can input a word to search

### Known Bugs

- Despite attempts at filtering, scraper still counts "the"s that are not visible on page.
